## Chubby Sports - NBA, NFL and Soccer Data for Dapper Enthusiasts

1. Install all dependencies from requirements file: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. The project can be run on your local computer with: `flask run` or `python app.py`

**NB:** `leaders.html` partial for each sport can be found inside each main `games.html` template (so you won't be able to find `leaders.html` in each `base.html`)
